## Our Topic, Initial Thoughts: 
PLACEHOLDER--- why did we select this topic?

## Primary Question:
This project concerns itself with the following question: Within the state of X or the country of X, can we predict the amount of leads based off the following features (spend, ad type, impressions)?

## Our Datasets:
### First-Download:
A concern held by our team was the use of "shallow", flat data files such as our first CSV. In this example, leveraged a sample firm's historical data across four social media platform accounts, with no more than 500 rows in total (spanning one-year of campaigns). We quickly realized that in lacking more rows, our features would lack the ability to train/test and then predict with accuracy during the ML portion of our project. 

### Dataset 1 - Primary/SM Firm Data:
As a result, we expanded our selection to a dataset that holds over 200,000 anonymized rows from our work.

### Dataset 2 - Secondary/Sample Survey:

### Issues in selecting the target and input features: 
Initially, by leveraging our primary dataset, we knew the target would either fall on the "impressions" or "leads" columns. Of the two, we understood the leads data to be the most beneficial target column, and more indecitive of a factor towards foot-traffic in our sample businesses. 

However, in debating the many machine learning modules, we were torn on which columns provided the most tangible meaning to predict or affect our target. A common question held was: How do we weight one column over another, such as the number of impressions vs the total spend on an ad?
