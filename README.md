PLACEHOLDER--- why did we select this topic?

## Primary Question:
This project concerns itself with answering the following primary question: Can we predict if a social media post will garner success (in the form of > 4.0% ER) based off a series of input variables (time of day, media type, number of hashtags, BU, copy length, etc.)?
## Our Datasets:
### First-Download:
A concern held by our team was the use of "shallow", flat data files such as our first CSV. In this example, leveraged a sample firm's historical data across four social media platform accounts, with no more than 500 rows in total (spanning one-year of campaigns). We quickly realized that in lacking more rows, our features would lack the ability to train/test and then predict with accuracy during the ML portion of our project. 

### Dataset 1 - Primary/SM Firm Data:
As a result, we expanded our selection to span from 2017-2022. This allowed for over 2,500 rows of data, uncleaned, in a CSV format. 

### Dataset 2 - Secondary/Sample Survey:

### Issues in selecting the target and input features: 
Initially, by leveraging our primary dataset, we knew the target would either fall on the "impressions" or "engagement rate" columns. Of the two, we understood the impressions data to be a raw sum, whereas, the engagement rate allowed us to view the percentage of success on a post. 
Since the ER is an easier snapshot on whether a post was successful, we decided to set this as our target variable. 

However, in debating the many machine learning modules, we were torn on which columns provided the most tangible meaning to predict or affect our target. A common question held was: How do we weight one column over another, such as the number of comments vs the copy length?
