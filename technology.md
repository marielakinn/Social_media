Technologies Used:
Data Cleaning, Exploration, and Analysis:
Pandas is the Python library we used to clean the data, removing null values, duplicates, and excess columns. We also used Python to perform exploratory analysis, determining which features should be inputted into the ML model.  

Database Storage:
We connected Python to PostgresSQL in order to store the data.

Machine Learning:
SciKitLearn is the ML library we are using to create a classifier.

Dashboard:
We will be using Tableau to display our findings.
